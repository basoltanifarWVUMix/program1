## Arithmetic library
Arithmetic library is place under **"com.generic.arithmetic"** package. 
 It consists of following methods:
* addition
* subtraction
* multiplication
* division
* power
* sqrt
* numberBaseConvertor

**All the methods arguments must be in String format.**

* *Hexadecimal number should start with "0X"*

## Build :
mvn clean install

## JAR File
JAR files are packaged with the ZIP file format, so you can use them for tasks such as loss less data compression, archiving, decompression, and archive unpacking. These tasks are among the most common uses of JAR files, and you can realize many JAR file benefits using only these basic features.
Project JAR file can be find under
**/Seng560-Prog1/target/Seng560-Prog1-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar**
